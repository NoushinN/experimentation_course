# Government of Canada's Experimentation Course

This book is developed as part of a chapter for Government of Canada's experimentation course. This course provides an introduction to experimentation and how it can be used as a powerful tool to address complex issues. It is not meant to turn beginners into experts, but will inform public servants who would like to take part in or set up an experiment.

The overall objectives is to make public servants informed consumers of evidence, and knowledgeable partners in experimental projects. More specifically, it will provide a degree of clarity on what experiments are, and how experiments should be planned and designed.

# Initiating an Experiment Module

The themes explored in this module are:
(i) identifying opportunities to experiment in government activities - be it policy, program, regulatory, service, or internal services,
