# Before starting an experiment

##  Deciding to experiment
- Do you need to experiment? Why or why not?
- Find a behaviour or object to test and think short term
- Keep it simple
- Start with a proof-of-concept test
- Have control and treatment groups (e.g. randomization)
- When results are in slice the data 
- Try out of the box thinking
- Measure everything that matters
- Look for natural experiments

##  Steps involved in designing an experiment

### Step 1: Choose a topic
- Ask yourself the following question: 1. What do I find interesting about the subject? 2. What is known about the subject? 3. What is missing and the gaps?

### Step 2: Narrow the topic 
- Ask yourself the following questions: 1. What do you need to know more about on the topic? 2. Are you interested in social, political, economic, gender, religious issues related to your topic? (General example) - Find a "slant" on your topic; 
- Will the results reveal something new or unexpected?
- What is in scope and what is out of scope?
- Clearly define hypotheses and explicitly state research questions

### Step 3: Find Resources
- Literature search: use the keywords you have compiled and use them to search for books in Library Catalogs or articles in online article databases 
- Team expertise 

### Step 4: Solicit feedback and collaboration
- Make sure the question is one that other people can get behind and support
- Establish collaboration agreements and executive buy-in
- Peer-review for clarity, scientific accuracy, and feasibility
- Does the team have the expertise required to complete the project? If not, who else needs to be on team

## Experimental design cycle

###  Problem statement
- Question
- Research
- Hypotheses (It….then…)

### Identify controls and experimental group as well as interventions/treatments
- A control group is a group of ‘test’ items in an experiment. The control group will be used to compare with the experimental group
- The control group doesn’t get the treatment 
- An experimental group is the group(s) of test items where only one change (called the experimental or independent variable) has been made
- The experimental group gets the treatment
- The experimental group may have dependent or independent variables

### Sample size consideration
- Maximize sample size: the larger the number of test items the more accurate the estimate
- Use representative groups: the samples must reflect the natural variation in the population. Use random or systematic sampling to reduce inherent bias in data.

### Determine outcome measures and visualization of outcome
- Independent variable or the factor that is manipulated or changed in placed on x-axis when grouping
- Dependent variable or the factor that is being measured is placed on y-axis during grouping

### Identify sources of error
- Mind the constants: the conditions that are kept the same for control and experimental groups
- Not controlling for factors or parameters that are kept the same in both control and experimental groups can result in error

### Report back and adapt

### Data analysis

### Implement intervention and measure outcomes and impacts
